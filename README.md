# How to import

These decks use the [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) format to make it easier to mantain through git. You may need to install [their plugin](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778) to import them.

These decks were exported with [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki), so you will need it to export them once you are done. Check a more detailed guide [here](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki#how-to-collaborate-via-github).
